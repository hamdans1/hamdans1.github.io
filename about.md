My journey to software development and programming has been a unique one. When I started at Montclair State University my plan was to take the LSAT's and go to law school. Sometimes life forces your hand, for me that happened when my father started to get really sick. I immediately took over responsibilities of running the family business, and the rest of life took a back seat.  To be fair, I don't think I really wanted to be a lawyer, so maybe this was for the best.

In 2011 I joined the Obama campaign as an unpaid intern. I was looking for a different challenge. I had been able to get the business to a point where it could run on autopilot as long as I tended to it for a couple of hours every evening. I used the rest of my time working at the Obama campaign and worked myself up from intern to office manager to a paid field worker and then finally to my final title, Regional Field Director/Data and Digital Director for OFA-NJ. In that position I was responsible for the processing and reporting of all of the volunteer and voter data across NJ for the 2012 election.  It was here when I decided that working within this particular intersection of tech, data, and politics was where I wanted to be.

After the campaign finished I started putting things into motion to sell my business. I knew what I wanted to do going forward and with my father passed and my family in a more comfortable place, I could start getting into action for myself. Actually selling the business would prove to be a hurdle in as we had a hostile landlord, but I eventually managed to get there.

After I sold the business I started making moves towards a coding program. I took the two week App Academy prep course to see if that would be a fit and I played with the idea of General Assembly.  Neither of these felt right though. I didn't like the idea of spending that much money when I already had a decent foundation, and I wanted the schedule flexibility of an online program. The Web Developer apprenticeship at Bloc turned out to be a perfect fit for what I wanted.

That brings me to now. I'm looking for my first job as a developer. My ideal job is to work somewhere that is building bold and innovative tech, trusts its developers with important work and feedback, and has a strong team culture. My ideal scenario is a place where I am knee deep in the work every day, constantly getting stronger. I know that I am a fast learner and I can thrive in the right environment. I have so many ideas and concepts that I want to learn how to implement, and I have a unique balance of work ethic and soft skills that might not be a regular feature of people employed in this field. I can't wait to see where my road takes me next.
