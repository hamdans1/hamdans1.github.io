title: Experiences at Bloc
---
It genuinely shocks me to think how far I've come in just three months or so. I started with absolutely nothing in terms of programming knowledge. I was definitely a little intimidated coming in, especially off of my experience with the App Academy Jumpstart program.  I wasn't sure what to expect, how fast the learning curve would come at me, or if I'd be able to stick with the program at all. 

So the first thing I think I gleamed from my Bloc experience was the ability to build a weekly schedule. It helps to have a mentor check in on you twice a week, but I don't think I would have been able to stick so tightly to such a long-term intense schedule.  As long as you can stick to your schedule, you will slog through. It might not always be at the rate you'd like, but the program is all about the time you put in. The more you buckle down and focus, the more you'll get out of the program.  

The results are almost instantaneous. The rush you get from a successful checkpoint is unparalleled. Even when you pass the early checkpoints, learning how to create an <a> tag or learning to create a stylesheet, the feeling of getting something to work is incredible. It's a feeling you find yourself chasing over and over again, always looking for the most elegant or creative solution.  

That's not to say it was always so rosy every step of the way. There are just as many, if not more, moments of intense doubt and pangs of failure. There are times where you think you don't belong and you may never belong. The mentors do a good job of coaxing you through those times, but there are times where you have to work yourself out.  You come out the other end as a stronger programmer, but that journey can be a struggle. 

The career prep experience through Bloc has also been rewarding. I have been pleasantly surprised at the thoroughness of the program, not so much in its ability to place anyone with certainty, but more with its ability to train you and prepare you for quickly finding a job upon completion.  The experience and preparation you get from the career prep program is long term in that it doesn't just get you to your first job and leave you.  You will be knowledgeable about your industry and know how to have a competitive interview performance. 

I still have a long way to go and I look forward to touching on this again in the future. I've just crossed the halfway mark and am working on Ruby right now. I look forward to pushing forward on my goal of becoming a talented FullStack developer and reporting back here when I can.
