title: Coding Challenges
---
There are some general challenges when it comes to coding as well as some specifics. Both tend to make you feel the same way though, like you are in over your head and you don't belong.  That feeling can be disastrous, especially in an atmosphere where self-motivation is so important.

Some of the general challenges are similar to things you'd see in other aspects of life: keeping a schedule, maintaining focus, being consistent, practicing good study habits, being thorough, etc. These are all daily challenges in this process that you have to work through and maintain constantly in order to stay sharp. 

Then there are challenges like imposter syndrome that can be crippling to your development as a programmer. This is an intimidating field to jump into, and because of that there will be times where you get serious doubts and fears. Overcoming those feelings is an important hurdle, and one that re-appears every time you have a difficult task set in front of you.  

When I was putting together my first real solo project there were at least three times when I thought I was in over my head and that I was proving myself a failure. The feeling of being stuck in a problem or not understanding something can be incredibly frustrating, even for the most experienced of programmers. For a beginner it can be absolutely crippling.  

When it comes to specific hurdles, I think there are a few when it comes to frontend work.  Feeling truly comfortable with javascript only comes with a lot of work. I only recently started to feel really confident with my javascript.

Learning parts of DOM scripting and jQuery also took me some time. For whatever reason I had trouble understanding how those concepts worked and how to manipulate the document and scope. Those concepts still didn't really click in for me until I got to AngularJS and I started to see the framework. For whatever reason seeing the scope interpreted in a different way, helped me to understand those other javascripting methods. 

Everyone will have different challenges on this path because everyone's mind will work differently. I know my brother felt like he really struggled with CSS and couldn't get past that for a little while. At the same time, he breezed through DOM scripting and jQuery. So everyone will face different specific technical challenges, but you can prepare yourself for all of them by responding to those general daily challenges the same way every day.
